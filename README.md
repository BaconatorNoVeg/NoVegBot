An all-purpose Discord bot for my Discord server, but can be self-hosted and used on other Discord servers. The bot is written completely in Python and uses only the core Discord Python library. Other libraries are planned on being added in the future to facilitate in the addition of new features.

## Upcoming Features
- Server moderation
- Music playing
- Imgur searching
- Gify searching
- Discord server text games
- Discord server point system

Source files coming soon.
